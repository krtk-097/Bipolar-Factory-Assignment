# Thoughts

The assignment was pretty good, got to know about storybook alot more and hopefully in future I will be able to implement this knowledge. It has different components which had to be made using Material UI which was little challenging as personally I use TailwindCSS for styling and to switch to Material UI was little challenge but it was fun and I learnt quite alot from this project.

Some of the challenges faced during the assignment were:

- Implementing Material UI for this project was little tricky but with the help of documentation I was able to figure out how to implement different components. Also configuring Material UI with Next.js was also a problem as Next.js got updated and there are little things which need to be checked so it doesn't cause Hydration error. 
- React Storybook was new thing for me and get through it was a challenging task and within limited time I was able to to grab and understand the what's, why's and how's part of storybook and personally I will use this in newer projects for building and testing.
