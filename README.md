# Thoughts

The assignment was pretty good, got to know about storybook alot more and hopefully in future I will be able to implement this knowledge. It has different components which had to be made using Material UI which was little challenging as personally I use TailwindCSS for styling and to switch to Material UI was little challenge but it was fun and I learnt quite alot from this project.
